# Multi-Threaded-Web-Crawler

A lightweight web crawler that begins from a seed URL and searches for valid PNG image links. It collects up to a user-specified number of unique PNGs (maximum 50) and logs them into a file. While crawling, it discovers new URLs to visit through a URL frontier and ensures efficiency by avoiding revisiting pages or duplicating PNG links.
